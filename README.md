# GildedRose refactoring Kata

I saw a [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) about this kata once and it amazed me. I always wanted to give it a shot. 


The GildedRose refactoring Kata is a good practicing sample for refactoring. The goal is to transform a nested decision logic (which is in a very bad shape) to a maintanable code where it is possible to add new functionality. In my opinion this is a perfect candidate for the saying from [Kent Beck](https://www.kentbeck.com/): _"For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change"_


I've started solely with the code, no tests given. To study this project you can step commit by commit starting from [500f811]( https://github.com/dobreffandras/GildedRoseKata/commit/500f81160ed0548ee1394adc5351fccdd3840564). 

The code (starting shape) is copied from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/csharp/GildedRose.cs)
